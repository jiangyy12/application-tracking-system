If you have ever come across the process of applying for jobs and internships, you must be knowing that it's not a cakewalk. Managing the job applications is a tedious task. Our application helps you to track and manage your job and school application process and helps you to control your application process without the need of messy excel sheets.

There are three basic features at the beginning. Developers design and build the application UI. Users can fetch relevant job oppotunities when entering key words from varaious available sites into application. J-Tracker also allow user to "Accept/Reject" suggested job profiles to be added to the wishlist.

To implement the available features, we improved the original project. We first developed the login page to help user store or manage their imformation separately. We added the application summary page to show application progress summary of each company and in order to enrich the contents and features, we implemented the page about shcool applications. The school application page helps users to manage the progress of the school application. At the beginning of the project, the data are stored in .csv file but now we implemented database (MySQL) on the basis of the original project to replace the original way.

J-Tracker now can help users to manage their job and school application and help users to control their application process without the need of messy excel sheets.
